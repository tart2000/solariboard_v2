Simple project to diplay messages on an airport-like display.

The front is based on the project [Solariboard](https://github.com/carlmw/SolariBoard) by Carlmw on Github.  

It uses a text-wrapping function to make sure the words aren't cut in the middle (unless they're rally too long). 

## What does it do?

- It shows messages on the index.html 
- The page /message allows you to add new messages and delete previous ones 

### Behavior 

It flips through the list of messages, updating the board each time. 

### Customization 

You can modify:

- the number of rows and lines in the index.html
- the 'zoom' in the app/solari.js file
- the time (in ms) messages are shown on the index.html
- the info message that appears at the bottom of the screen in index.html

### Going forward 

- Add sound that fits the flipping
- Button to exit fullscreen 

### Limits 

- For some reason, the board doesn't work on mobile / tablet...
