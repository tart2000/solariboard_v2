The front is based on the project [Solariboard](https://github.com/carlmw/SolariBoard) by Carlmw on Github.  

It uses a text-wrapping function to make sure the words aren't cut in the middle. 

## What does it do?

- It shows messages 
- The page /message allows you to add new messages and delete previous ones
